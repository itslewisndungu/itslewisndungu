# Hi. 👋 I'm Lewis Ndung'u.

I am a engineer who loves doing things on and for the web. I also love the linux shell and the crazy things you can do in it.

## What im currently up to:

- Learning and building restful backends using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Django rest framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) 🗄
- Learning all about the cloud and [Google cloud platform](https://cloud.google.com) ☁️
- Advancing on my linux journey on [Arcolinux](https://arcolinux.com/) 😎
- Learning some [bash scripting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPwyp2NG-bE) here and there. Makes me a better nerd 😏

Thats pretty much it. Guess the learning never stops huh.
